# Operationalize Machine Learning Models Using MLFlow
## How to integrate the machine learning models to production ready code. !!
## Challanges and Key Principles of the ML Systems
   * Need for Reproduciability (Versioning Softwares).
   * Data Dependencies. (Most consequensial difference between traditional webapp and ML pipeline is the fact that primary inputs to the systems are not just code, 
     while there are two equal consequensial inbound components i.e code+data. )
   * Configration issues.
   * Data and feature Engineering.
